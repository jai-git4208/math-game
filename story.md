# The Eternal Equation

## Core Theme

inspired by Frieren: Beyond Journey’s End  
(sorry im autistic :>)

> Time passes. People fade. Knowledge remains.

This is not a fast game.  
This is not a loud game.  
This is a game about things breaking slowly.

## PROLOGUE  
### The World After the Heroes

Long ago, a party of heroes saved the world.

The demon king fell.  
People celebrated.  
Songs were sung very loudly.  
Statues were carved in places no one visits anymore.

Then time moved on.  
Like it always does.

You are **Aeris**, an elf mage.  
You age slowly, which sounds cool until everyone you know doesn’t.

Centuries pass like badly written diary pages.

You also don’t travel alone anymore.  
At some point, you picked up a small companion.  
They’re cheerful.  
A little stupid.  
Kind of a cupcake of a person.

They make the long years feel shorter.

The heroes you once traveled with:

- The warrior is a name carved into stone  
- The priest exists only in stories that change every time they’re told  
- The mathematician-sage is forgotten entirely  

That part still bothers you.

Only you remain.

### Opening Scene

The world is peaceful.

Too peaceful.

You stand in front of an old statue.
Its inscription has faded.

You try to remember who it honored.

You cannot.


You pretend that doesn’t hurt.

## The Central Mystery  
### The Eternal Equation

Before demons.  
Before heroes.  
Before kingdoms that don’t exist anymore.

There was something else.

People called it:

**The Eternal Equation**

It governed:

- The balance of mana  
- The flow of time  
- Why things didn’t just fall apart immediately  

It wasn’t magic.  
It wasn’t a god.

It was a truth.  
Written down in numbers.

When the heroes fought the Demon King, something went wrong.
The Equation fractured.

Not shattered.
Just… cracked.

The world survived.  
But now it decays in quiet ways.

Villages forget things.  
Bridges collapse a little too early.  
Magic behaves strangely, like it forgot its own rules.

Most people don’t notice.

You do.

---

## WORLD STRUCTURE

The Equation split into fragments.  
Each fragment drifted somewhere else.

Each one is locked behind something simple.
Something everyone thinks they understand.

Math.

---

## Region 1  
### The Village of Fading Numbers

**Math Theme:** Addition & Subtraction  
**Mood:** Quiet. Tired. Slightly sad.

#### Story

The villagers struggle with counting.

Not in an obvious way.  
They just… get it wrong.

Food disappears sooner than expected.  
Trades never feel fair.  
No one starves, but no one understands why supplies keep running out.

An old shopkeeper sighs and says:

> “Numbers don’t feel… solid anymore.”

You know what he means.

#### Trial

To stabilize the village, you must:

- Restore basic arithmetic  
- Fix broken ledgers  
- Rebalance small trades that shouldn’t matter, but do  

#### Reward

**Spell Unlocked:** *Summation Light*

> Adds what was once lost.  
> Sometimes that’s numbers.  
> Sometimes it’s something else.

---

## Region 2  
### The Forest of Repeating Paths

**Math Theme:** Multiplication & Patterns  
**Mood:** Dreamlike. Annoying. A little funny.

#### Story

Paths in the forest loop.

People swear they walked straight.
They swear it was only five minutes.

They still come back to the same tree.

The forest doesn’t care about direction.  
It cares about patterns.

Your companion keeps getting confused and blaming the trees.

#### Trial

- Identify repeating sequences  
- Predict growth instead of counting steps  
- Break loops that feel endless  

#### Lore

> “Nature does not count like humans do.  
> It multiplies.”

You think the sage would’ve liked this place.

---

## Region 3  
### Ruins of the Forgotten Sage

**Math Theme:** Algebra  
**Mood:** Quiet. Heavy. Respectful.

#### Story

These ruins belonged to the fourth hero.

The one history forgot.

No songs.  
No statues.  
No name.

Only equations carved into stone walls.

He believed something very simple:

> “Equations outlive people.”

He was right.

#### Trial

- Solve for unknown values  
- Restore missing variables  
- Balance equations that have been broken for centuries  

#### Moment

You find a small carving, hidden behind debris:

> “To whoever finds this —  
> I’m sorry they forgot me.”

You stand there longer than you need to.

---

## Region 4  
### The Tower Where Time Slips

**Math Theme:** Functions & Graphs  
**Mood:** Melancholy. Soft. Painful in a quiet way.

#### Story

Time behaves strangely here.

A minute on one floor is a year on another.
Voices echo from moments that already passed.

You see memories overlap.
Faces you once knew.
Faces you tried to forget.

Your companion doesn’t fully understand what’s happening.
That’s probably for the best.

#### Trial

- Understand how values change over time  
- Read graphs as stories, not charts  
- Predict outcomes instead of reacting to them  

#### Core Line

> “Time isn’t broken.  
> It’s just following a function you don’t understand yet.”

You wish someone had told you that earlier.

---

## Final Region  
### The Sky Archive

**Math Theme:** Logic & Proof  
**Mood:** Calm. Clear. Final.

#### Truth

The Eternal Equation was never destroyed.

It was split.

Humans feared it.
They feared a truth that could explain too much.

The Sage chose obscurity so the world could stay free.
Messy.
Human.

Now the fragments are here.

And the choice is yours.

---

## Endings

### Ending A: Restoration

You restore the Equation completely.

Magic stabilizes.  
History stops changing.  
Nothing is forgotten ever again.

The world is perfect.

And very still.

---

### Ending B: Acceptance

You leave the Equation fragmented.

The world remains flawed.  
People forget.  
They relearn.  
They move on.

You walk away.

> Not everything needs to last forever.
