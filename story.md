# PROLOGUE The World After the Heroes

Long ago, a party of heroes saved the world.
The demon king fell.
Songs were sung.
Statues were carved.

Then… **time moved on**.

You are **Aeris**, an elf mage who ages slowly, watching centuries pass like pages in a book. You also recruit a pretty little cupcake with yourself.

The heroes you once traveled with:

* The warrior is a name on stone
* The priest is a memory
* The mathematician-sage is forgotten entirely

Only **you** remain.

---

### Opening Scene

```text
The world is peaceful.

Too peaceful.

You stand before an old statue.
Its inscription has faded.

You try to remember who it honored.
You cannot.
```

## The Central Mystery — The Eternal Equation

Long before demons, long before heroes, the world ran on something called:

> **The Eternal Equation**

It governed:

* Balance of mana
* Flow of time
* Stability of reality

Not a spell.
Not a god.
A **truth**, expressed in mathematics.

When the heroes fought the Demon King, the Equation was **fractured**.

The world survives — but slowly decays.

Villages forget.
Bridges collapse.
Magic becomes unstable.

# WORLD STRUCTURE

Each region contains a **Fragment of the Equation**
Each fragment is locked behind a **math concept**

---

## Region 1: The Village of Fading Numbers

**Math Theme:** Addition & Subtraction
**Mood:** Quiet, gentle sadness

### Story

Villagers can no longer count supplies correctly.
No one starves but no one remembers why food runs out.

An old shopkeeper says:

> “Numbers don’t feel… solid anymore.”

### Trial

To stabilize the village:

* Restore **basic arithmetic**
* Fix broken ledgers
* Rebalance trades

### Reward

**Spell Unlocked:** *Summation Light*

> “Adds what was once lost.”

---

## Region 2: The Forest of Repeating Paths

**Math Theme:** Multiplication & Patterns
**Mood:** Confusing, dreamlike

### Story

Paths loop endlessly.
Travelers swear they walked straight — yet returned to the start.

The forest obeys **patterns**, not direction.

### Trial

* Recognize repeating sequences
* Predict growth
* Break infinite loops

### Lore Line

> “Nature does not count like humans do. It multiplies.”

---

## Region 3: Ruins of the Forgotten Sage

**Math Theme:** Algebra
**Mood:** Ancient, reverent

### Story

These ruins belonged to the **fourth hero** —
the one erased from history.

His name no longer exists.

He believed:

> “Equations outlive people.”

### Trial

* Solve for unknowns
* Restore missing variables
* Balance broken formulas etched in stone

### Emotional Hit

You find a carving:

> “To whoever finds this —
> I’m sorry they forgot me.”


## Region 4: The Tower Where Time Slips

**Math Theme:** Functions & Graphs
**Mood:** Melancholy, reflective

### Story

Time moves unevenly.
A minute upstairs equals a year below.

You see memories overlap.
Faces you once loved appear… then vanish.

### Trial

* Understand how values change over time
* Read graphs as *stories*
* Predict outcomes, not just answers

### Core Line

> “Time isn’t broken.
> It’s just following a function you don’t understand yet.”

## Final Region: The Sky Archive

**Math Theme:** Logic & Proof
**Mood:** Peaceful acceptance

### Truth Revealed

The Eternal Equation was never destroyed.
It was **split**, because humans feared its power.
The Sage chose obscurity so the world could move freely.
You must decide:

* **Restore it completely**
* OR **leave it fragmented**, letting the world remain imperfect but alive

---

# Endings (Multiple)

### Ending A: Restoration

The Equation is complete.
Magic stabilizes.
History becomes fixed.

But the world stops changing.

### Ending B: Acceptance (Canon Frieren Style)

You leave the Equation incomplete.
The world remains flawed.
But people keep learning, forgetting, growing.



sorry im autistic :>
